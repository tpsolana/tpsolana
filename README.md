## BONK! dApp (February 2025)
- Utilizing the Solana dApp Scaffold I created a basic website that allowed the user to overlay a GIF over their image and receive a new GIF.
- Then I hooked up the button to wait for a successful transaction through our website before outputting the gif for the user.
- I also created a button that allowed the user to have a pre-programmed tweet about their experience sent to twitter.

- Next the user has two options, create a new assessment or use our catalog page to look up an existing assessment. I created the catalog page using HTML/CSS/SQL to allow users to search based on the name, address, or the assessment status.

- Finally the user is greeted with their uploaded floorplan as well as a toolbar with an array of icons. We designed this page to show three levels of priority for each icon and allow for any of these icons to be placed directly on the floorplan.
